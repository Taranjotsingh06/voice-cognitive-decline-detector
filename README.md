# Voice-Based Cognitive Decline Detection 🧠🎙️

This project is a proof-of-concept pipeline that detects early indicators of cognitive stress or decline using voice data. It combines audio signal processing, NLP, and unsupervised ML techniques.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

As part of MemoTag's speech intelligence module, the goal is to:
- Analyze voice recordings to identify cognitive decline patterns.
- Extract features like pauses, hesitation markers, vague word usage, speech rate, pitch variability, etc.
- Use clustering and anomaly detection to group or flag unusual speech patterns.
